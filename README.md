# escdle v1.1

Inspired by Heardle, escdle is a daily song guessing game for songs from the Eurovision Song Contest. Users can guess a random song within 5 tries once per day, aiming to guess the song in the least amount of tries. After completing their daily guess, users can switch to endless mode and practise forever, as well as viewing their overall success statistics. escdle was made with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. The game can be played at https://escdle.netlify.app.
