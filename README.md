# escdle v1.2

Inspired by Heardle, escdle is a daily song guessing game for songs from the Eurovision Song Contest. Users can guess a random song within 5 tries once per day, aiming to guess the song in the least amount of tries. After completing their daily guess, users can switch to endless mode and practise forever, as well as viewing their overall success statistics, and for an extra challenge they can toggle including national final songs into the song pool as well. escdle was made with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. The game can be played at https://escdle.netlify.app. You can read about the creation of escdle on my blog https://radhikadhanji.netlify.app/blog.
